# Lab assignments for course CS2610:Computer Organization and Architecture Lab

Each assignment folder contains the relevant problem statement and the corresponding solution files containing the code that were submitted.

The code in assignment6 is meant to be used as a substitute to the "scheduler.c" file provided by default by the <a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/~rajeev/jwac12/">USIMM simulator</a>

Assignments 4, 6, 7, 8 were team assignments and were done together by <a href="https://github.com/Bala-A87">Balakrishnan A</a> and myself.
